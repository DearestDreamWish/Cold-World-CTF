# Cold-World-CTF
CTF investigation and research in the real world.


What about investigation and research as CTFs?
Would then be in the real world.
Could be interesting.


Where the proof for an answer for a "question" or if a "statement" is right or not would be the !flag.


What would you like to call it?
Anyone can participate and anyone can invite.
Every CTF "question" or "statement" can have a codename.


Codename for this CTF !flag={Cold-World-CTF}
